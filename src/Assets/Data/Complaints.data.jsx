    desc: `I am writing to bring to your attention the current power outage situation in our society. It has been three days now since the power went out, and there has been no response from the electricity department. The power outage has affected not just the homes, but also the local businesses and shops.

    The lack of electricity has caused immense inconvenience and hardship to the residents of the society. We are facing difficulties in carrying out our daily activities such as cooking, studying, and working from home. The situation is even worse for the elderly and young children who are more vulnerable to the heat and lack of air conditioning.
    
    I request immediate action from the electricity department to resolve this issue. The power outage is affecting the lives of so many people, and it is imperative that it is restored as soon as possible. Please send a team to assess the situation and resolve the issue.
    
    I hope that this complaint will receive your urgent attention and that the situation will be resolved soon.
    
    Thank you.
    
    Sincerely,
    
    Naveen Ramakrishnan`,
